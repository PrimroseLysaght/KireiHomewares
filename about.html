  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <p>We hope our name signifies some of the most distinctive characteristics of the Ginkgo in our endeavour to gather objects for those who appreciate good design and beauty in their daily lives, both to look at and to use.</p>
  <p>At Kirei Homewares, our selection of inventory is guided by the Japanese conceptual term Yo-no-bi ("beauty through use"). Alongside Yo-no-bi, well designed equipment must have high functionality for multiple uses.  A plate comes alive when food is placed within its boundaries. Tools and equipment used daily should be minimal, practical and beautiful.</p>
  <p>Our primary focus is well crafted, well designed contemporary Japanese household items such as ceramics, porcelain, glassware, wood crafts, ironware, bath and bed textiles or unique pieces with which to bring delight to their users.</p>
  <p>Kirei Homewares's inventory is selected by founder and owner Prim Lysaght.</p>
